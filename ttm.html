<h2>TTM</h2>
<h2>NAME</h2>
ttm - macro processor
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
ttm
[-B <i>integer</i>]
[-d <i>string</i>]
[-D <i>name=string</i>]
[-e <i>string</i>]
[-i]
[-I <i>directory</i>]
[-o <i>file</i>]
[-V]
[--]
[<i>file</i>]
[<i>arg...</i>]

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2
The <b>ttm</b> macro processor
scans the input file and executes any macro invocations encountered.
If no file is specified or if file is '-', standard input is read.
Note that in this latter case, all of standard input will be read
up to EOF and then processing will commence.
<p>
Any arguments after the file name are provided to ttm using the
<i>#&lt;argv;i&gt;</i> function.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
Except where indicated, all flags may be repeated multiple times.
<dl>
<dt><b>-B <i>integer</i></b><br>
<dd>
Set the internal buffer size. The default is 10 megabytes (2^21 bytes);
The suffix m is allowed to indicate multiplying by 2^20.
<p>
<dt><b>-d <i>string</i></b><br>
<dd>
Set a variety of debug options as encoded in the string.
<p><dt><b>-D <i>name=string</i></i></b><br>
<dd>
Predefine the name as a function whose body is the string.
Exactly equivalent to -e #&lt;ds;name;string&gt;.
<p><dt><b>-e <i>string</i></b><br>
<dd>
Scan the string and execute any macro invocations. Any output
left after execution is discarded.
<p><dt><b>-i</i></b><br>
<dd>
After executing any -D and -e options and executing any input file,
enter the read-eval loop to execute commands interactively.
<p><dt><b>-I <i>directory</i></b><br>
<dd>
Append the directory to the include path.
<p><dt><b>-o <i>file</i></b><br>
<dd>
Send all output to the specified file. If not specified, then
output is sent to standard output.
<p><dt><b>-V</i></b><br>
<dd>
Output the version number of ttm and then exit.
<p><dt><b>--</i></b><br>
<dd>
Signal the end of options and disable further option
processing. Any arguments after the -- are treated as a file
name followed by arguments.
<p><dt><b><i>file</i></b><br>
<dd>
Specify the main file to execute. Any -D and -e arguments will be
executed before the main file is executed.
<p><dt><b><i>arg...</i></b><br>
<dd>
Specify arguments that are accessible using the <i>#&lt;argv&gt;</i> function.
</dl>

<h2>MODIFICATIONS</h2>
This ttm processor adheres closely to the specification in the
document entitled .
However, the following modifications and extensions have been implemented.
<ol>
<li>
The original ttm did not provide any mechanism
for handling unpaired instances of '<' or '>'. A special escape
mechanism is provided for this using backslash style escapes.
So any character can be preceded by '\\' and it will be passed as-is.
The preceding '\\' will not be removed except at the point where
the output is sent to its final destination -- to standard output or
to a file specified using -o.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
It is possible to change the set of meta-characters using the
#&lt;ttm&gt; function. The default set of meta-characters are
as defined in the ttm specification, with the addition of '\\'
as the default escape character.
<p>
<li>
This version of ttm supports (more or less) utf-8. The meta characters
are restricted to be a subset of the US-ASCII 7-bit subset of utf-8.
Otherwise, strings may contain any 8-bit value except 0xff.
This allows for inclusion of utf-8 codepoints, but no validation
is performed to see if the string is actually valid utf-8.
</ol>

<h2>ADDITIONAL PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>#&lt;ttm;option;arg1;arg2;...&gt;</b><br>
<dd>This function provides a general mechanism for altering
the behavior of the macro processor.
The currently defined options are as follows.
<dl>
<p><dt>meta<br>
<dd>Change the set of meta-characters, except the escape
character.  It takes one argument that specifies the set of
meta characters. Setting the default behavior would use
this invocation: #&lt;ttm;meta;\#\&lt;\;\&gt;&gt;.
</dl>
