'''TTM''' is a [[programming language]] developed in 1968
by Steven Caine and E. Kent Gordon at the
[[California Institute of Technology]].
The following description is taken from the original
TTM reference manual [[ttm68]].

TTM Is a recursive, interpretive language designed primarily
for string manipulation, text editing, macro definition and
expansion, and other applications generally classified as
systems programming. It is derived, primarily, from GAP
[[GAP]] and GPM [[GPM]].

Initially, TIM was planned as the macro processing portion
of an assembler for the IBM System/360 and, as such, was
designed to overcome the restrictions and inconsistencies
which existed in the standard assemblers for that system
[9,10], In addition, it was designed to have all of the
power possessed by earlier general macro assemblers but with
the unfortunate syntactic and semantic difficulties removed
[4,5,6,7,8].

During the development of TIM, it became apparent that
applications other than assembler macro processing were
possible. These include data editing, text manipulation,
expression compiling, and macro processing for language
processors other than assemblers.

The initial version of TTM was implemented to run in a
conversational manner under the Caltech Basic Time Sharing
System for the IBM System/360-50 [13].
Other versions have been written to run in the batch processing environment
of OS/360 and to operate in front of or in conjunction with
various language processors.

==Notes==

* Although unacknowledged, TTM appears to have been inspired
by [[TRAC]] and the description of the characteristics of TRAC
also apply to TTM.
